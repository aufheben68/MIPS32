Some of my first MIPS32 projects back in 2011.

Please keep in mind that in this repo you will find 4 different MIPS32 small projects.
You can find more informations about what each one of them does, in the section below:

- multiplier.s: is a simple program that multiplies two given numbers.
- gcd.s: finds the greater common divisor among two different numbers.
- names_concatenation.s : concatenates a name and a surname, then outputs a greetings message.
